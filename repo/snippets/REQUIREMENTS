### Processor
Intel i3 dual core @ 2Ghz or better. (Operators may be able to use a lesser system, but it is not supported.)

### OS
Ubuntu Linux version 18.04 LTS or later LTS version.

### Memory
8Gb Ram.  More is better.

### Network
IPv6 is _required_. NAT-ed IPv4 is acceptable for basic needs. A public IPv4 address assigned to a local interface is needed if you want to resolve IPv4 requests for dStor too.  Resolving IPv4 requests for dStor is optional but may lead to more data service.

### Storage
Partitions must be empty and mounted somewhere that is reboot proof.  XFS is recommended, however ZFS, EXT4 and other file systems should be ok.

#### Data Partition
2 TiB in size (or more) and the mount point's final subpath must end in `data`.

Example: `/mnt/dstor/outpost-data` OR `/data`

#### Cache Partition
The cache partition must be 20% in size of the data partition (or more) and its mount point final subpath must end in `cache`.

Example: `/mnt/dstor/outpost-cache` OR `/cache`
